Here is my implementation of popular RL algorithms. I did refer many popular code bases while writing my implementation.

The algorithms I have implemented are  - 

1. [DQN](https://github.com/Deepakgthomas/RL_Algorithms/blob/main/dqn_non_image_cuda.py)
2. PPO
3. DDQN
4. PG (Work needed)
5. DDPG (Work needed)
6. SAC (Work needed)
